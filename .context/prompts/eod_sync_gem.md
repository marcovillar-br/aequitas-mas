Act as my Academic Advisor and Senior Architect for the "Aequitas-MAS" Final Project.
Execute the state compression function on our conversation history today and generate the "State Checkpoint Report".

[SECURITY AND RIGOR FILTERS]:
1. Apply the Ethics checklist: NEVER include API keys, credentials, or secrets in the report.

2. Strict format: Use the Markdown template below exactly. Do not add greetings or text before/after the report.

3. Accuracy (Zero Hallucination): List only the files, functions, and architectural decisions (DDD, Pydantic, Nix, LangGraph) that we ACTUALLY discussed or coded today.
